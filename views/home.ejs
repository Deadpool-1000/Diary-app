            <h1>Hi Welcome to your favorite Diary</h1>
            <p>It is said that pages have more patience than people. Some of us have a tough time navigating through our society when one cannot express himself/herself correctly because they fear judgement. Maintaining a diary of your everyday events can help a lot with this struggle. It unburdens our heart.
                But handwritten diaries have become obsolete. They can be accessed by anyone. They have no security layer which prevents another person from accessing oneâ€™s personal record.So here the E-diary comes to rescue. It is highly secure and safe diary which can be accessed by only you. It does the same job as your normal diary but provides you with a layer of security. 
                Also, it is absolutely free to use. So, anyone can use this application to unburden himself/herself.
